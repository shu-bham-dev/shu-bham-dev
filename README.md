## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 🚀 I build apps, but sometimes forget to deploy them.
- ☕ My blood type is **C++offee**.
- 🛠️ Learning **System Design**… slowly. At this rate, Amazon might design another system before I finish.
- 🎯 Fitness goal: **Get abs. Current status: Got kebabs.**
- 🧘 Practicing **NoFap**—but my GitHub streak is still shorter.

### 🤖 What I Build

- **AI Apps:** Start with *“AI will change the world”* → end with `npm install failed`.
- **Microservices:** 1 service per bug. Scale = proportional to the number of errors.
- **Blog Apps:** CRUD works perfectly… until I add Auth. Then chaos.

---

### 😂 Fun Facts

- 🐞 I don’t fix bugs. I just rename them to features.
- 📦 My S3 bucket is a graveyard of `final_version_v2_REAL.zip`.
- 🏖️ I travel sometimes… but mostly from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1`.
- 💸 Deployed apps on AWS Free Tier. Still waiting for that surprise bill.

---

### 🔥 Current Status

- 📚 Learning System Design like Netflix, but my brain is buffering.
- 🧑‍💻 Building an AI SaaS app… so far, only the README is production-ready.
- 💡 **Dream:** Passive income.
  **Reality:** Passive bugs.

Want me to make a **spicier version with colorful shields.io badges** (like `![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black)` etc.) so your README looks both **funny + professional**?
